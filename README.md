Welcome to CS 2800! This repository contains information about the class, setup
instructions, and links to useful information.

include HTML document structure and styling, accessibility, JavaScript, React,
and JavaScript unit testing. The course assumes that students have successfully
completed an undergraduate programming course such as CS 1160.

## Instructor

Jason Cheatham (jason.cheatham@wright.edu)

## Time and room

The class meets Mondays and Wednesdays from 6:30-7:50pm in Russ 339.

Office hours are after class &mdash; Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:50-8:50pm in
Russ 339.

Students may also attend lectures and take exams remotely. Lectures will be
broadcast through Collaborate, and exams will be administered through Pilot.
Remote lecture and exam times are the same as in-class meeting times.

Lecture recordings will be available, although students are highly encouraged to
attend lectures at the time they are given to be able to ask questions. Remote
exams will not require the use of LockDown.

## Masks

The university has enacted a mask mandate for Fall 2021. Masks must be worn at
all times in campus buildings, including during class. Any student attending
class in-person must be wearing a mask at all times unless the student has
obtained an official exemption _and_ notified the instructor of the exemption.
Students not wishing to wear a mask may attend class remotely. If you forget
your mask, you can get one from various locations on campus (Student Union front
desk, Library, vending machines).

Students who show up to in-person class without a mask will be asked to leave.
If a student repeatedly refuses to wear a mask, they may be reported to Office
of Student Conduct for further action.

## Textbook

There is no textbook for this course. Instead, we will be using freely available
resources, including:

- [Learn Web Development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com)
- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

## Required software

Students will need

- A computer with a current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  installed (Node 12+)
- A text or code editor ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a good free
  option)
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- A git client (the [git command line tool](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
  [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), etc.)

See the [GitHub doc](./github.md) for more information about using GitHub for
assignments.

Assignments will typically be made on Thursdays and will be due at 11:59pm on
the following Tuesday.

Both the lecture schedule and assignment due dates are subject to change. You
are responsible for monitoring Pilot for notifications of any schedule changes.

## Academic integrity

Cheating on assignments or exams will not be tolerated, where ”cheating” is
loosely defined as turning in someone else’s work as your own. If you are found
to have cheated, you will get an automatic 0 on the exam or assignment for the
first offense, and a failing grade in the course for the second offense.
