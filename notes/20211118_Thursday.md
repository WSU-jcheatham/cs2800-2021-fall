# Thursday, November 18

Today I reviewed the assignment 10 solution, disucssed one more point about
React state management, talked about unit testing, then briefly previewed
assignment 11.

The scratch files from today's lecture are
[here](https://github.com/WSU-jcheatham/cs2800-playground/tree/20211118_Thursday).

## Initializing state variables

Last time we talked about using `useState` to create state variables.

```js
export default function SearchField(props) {
  const [input, setInput] = useState();
  const [data, setData] = useState();

  async function search() {
    const params = new URLSearchParams();
    params.set('term', input);
    const response = await fetch(`/search?${params}`);
    setData(await response.json());
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={input} onChage={(event) => setInput(event.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={search}>Search</button>
    </div>
  );
```

This looks resonable enough -- we have a controlled input and a button. When you
click the button, the component fetches from a search endpoint. However, there's
a problem here.

If the user clicks Search before typing anything, `input` will be `undefined`.
When a URLSearchParam value is `undefined`, it is turned into the literal string
`'undefined'` when the params object is converted to a string, meaning we'd be
fetching `/search?term=undefined`. That's probably not what we want, because
as far as the server knows we'd be searching for the string `'undefined'`.

To prevent this situation from coming up, we can give state variables an initial
value. In our case, we could say

```js
const [input, setInput] = useState('');
```

This will initialize `input` with the value `''` (empty string). Passing a value
to `useState` will only initialize the state variable, it won't reset it when
the function is next rendered (which is good). Now if the user hits the Search
button without typing anything, we'll end up fetching `/search?term=`, which is
what we _should_ be fetching when the input is empty.

## Unit testing

Coming soon...
