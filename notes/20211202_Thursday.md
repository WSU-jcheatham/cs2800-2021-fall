# Thursday, December 2 - Final review

Final exam is Thursday, December 9.

## HTML

HTML is a language of tags and attributes. Tags typically look like
`<div>content</div>`, with an opening tag, some content, and a closing tag. Some
tags, like `<img>`, don't accept content, and don't have a closing tag.

Tags can have attributes, which are basically like tag metadata. For example, an
`<img>` tag might have a `src` attribute that tells the browser where to get the
image file that should be displayed by the `<img>` tag. A tag with an attribute
looks like:

```html
<img src="some_file.jpg" />
```

Attribute values are always strings. A tag may have multiple attributes. Some
attributes, like `id`, are global -- any tag may have such an attribute. Other
attributes, like `src` for an `<img>` tag, are meaningful only for certain tags.

A valid document must have a certain minimal tag structure. By "valid" we mean a
document that properly follows the document specification. A browser will also
render invalid documents, and it may do a very good job, but invalid documents
may not render consistently between different browsers. A minimal valid document
looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Page title</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

The `<head>` part of an HTML document gets metadata (information _about_ a
document), while the `<body>` gets visible content (what you can actually see in
the browser).

One bit of metadata that you _can_ see is the document title, set by the
`<title>` tag in `<head>`. The content of this tag is used as the title of a
page in the browser's title bar or in the active tab.

## CSS

CSS is a language for describing the "look" of a page. With CSS you can change
colors, set heights and widths, add borders, and make a range of other visual
changes to a page.

Common properties include:

- `color: blue` - set the foreground (text) color
- `background: red` - set the background color
- `width: 100px` - set the width
- `height: 100px` - set the height
- `border: solid 1px #ddd` - set the style, thickness, and color of an element
  border
- `border-radius: 10px` - round the corners of a border
- `padding: 1em` - set the space between an element's content and its edge
- `margin: 1em` - set the space between an element's edge and any other elements
  around it

The CSS language is used to change style properties on specific elements in a
page. You can do this in three ways:

- Using a `style` attribute on an element
  ```html
  <p style="background: green; color: white">Hello</p>
  ```
- Using selectors in a `<style></style>` block
  ```html
  <style>
    p {
      background: green;
      color: white;
    }
  </style>
  ```
- Using selectors in a separate file and using a
  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style_file.css">` tag to load it

When using a `style` attribute, the styles apply to the element with the
attribute, and potentially to any elements it contains.

When using a `<style></style>` block or a style file, styles apply to elements
matching the style selector. We talked about 3 kinds of selector, in ascending
order of specificity:

- type, like `h2` or `p`
- class, like `.rounded` or `.bordered`
- id, like `#root` or `#page-content`

If more than one selector matches a given element, styles from the selector with
higher specificity will override styles from selectors with lower specificity.

If two selectors with equal specificity match, styles from the selector that was
seen _last_ by the browser will take priority over those from other selectors.

## JavaScript

### Operators

JavaScript has similar mathematical and boolean operators as many other
languages (`+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `==`, `&&`, `||`, `<`, `>`). One unique operator
is `===`, the strict equality operator. This operator works similarly to the
basic equality operator (`==`). However, the basic equality operator will coerce
the values that are being compared to a common type, allowing values of
different types, such as integers and strings, to compare as "equal". For
example, this is true: `1 == '1'`.

The strict equality operator, on the other hand, requires that the values being
compared be of the same type to be equal. `1 === '1'` is false.

Another operator that isn't unique to JavaScript but is used more in JavaScript
than other languages is the ternary operator: `?:`. This operator is a bit like
an `if` statement. The left of the `?` is a boolean condition, the value
immediately after the `?` will be used if the condition is true, and the value
after the `:` will be used if the condition is false.

```js
let letterGrade = grade >= 90 ? 'A' : 'not A';
```

### Loops

JavaScript has multiple kinds of loops, each suited to a different situation.

The `while` and `do-while` loops are the simplest type of loop. They loop as
long as a boolean condition is true. The difference between the two is that the
`do-while` loop checks its condition at the end of the loop, so it is guaranteed
to always run at least once.

```js
let found = false;
while (!found) {
  found = lookForThing();
}

found = false;
do {
  found = lookForThing();
} while (!found);
```

The basic `for` loop is good for counting and for iterating through arrays. The
part of a for loop in parenthesis has three parts, separated by semicolons. The
first part is used to initialize a loop control variable. The second part is the
condition under which the loop will continue to loop. The third part tells how
to update the loop control variable after each pass of the loop.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

The `for-of` loop is specifically suited for **iterating through arrays** or
array-like objects. It declares a loop variable that is assigned the next item
in an array before each pass of the loop.

```js
for (const item of arr) {
  console.log(item);
}
```

The `for-in` loop is specifically suited for **iterating through object
properties**. It declares a loop variable that is assigned the next property
from an object before each pass of the loop.

```js
for (const property of obj) {
  console.log(`obj[${property}] = ${obj[property]}`);
}
```

Additionally, arrays support a `forEach` method that can be used to loop through
their contents.

```js
arr.forEach((item) => console.log(item));
```

### Arrays and objects

Arrays in JavaScript are lists of values. They don't have to be the same type.
You can access, and update, items in an array using `[]`, like `arr[0]` or
`arr[3] = 10`. JavaScript arrays will not throw errors if you try to read or
write to indexes beyond the current size of the array.

Objects in JavaScript are key-value maps. An object contains a set of unique
keys (also knowni as "properties"), each associated with a value (the values
don't have to be unique). Object properties can be accessed with `[]` like
arrays, but are more often accessed using `.` notation. For example:

```js
const obj = {
  name: 'Bob',
  weight: 150,
};
```

You can access the `name` property as `obj['name']` or `obj.name`.

Arrays and objects can contain other arrays or objects. If you need to access a
value in a nested array or object, thinking about doing so as a step by step
process. For example, to access the third item in the `grades` array for the
second student in the array below:

```js
const students = [
  { name: 'Bob Smith', grades: [95, 82, 75, 92, 95] },
  { name: 'Jill Jackson', grades: [92, 80, 73, 90, 92] },
  { name: 'Sam Baker', grades: [90, 77, 70, 87, 90] },
];

console.log(students[1].grades[2]);
```

The value of `students[1]` will be the second student object. The value of
`students[1].grades` will be the `grades` array in the second student object.
Therefore `students[1].grades[2]` is the third item from the `grades` array in
the second student object.

## DOM

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a way of representing an HTML document as a
JavaScript data structure, a tree of Node objects. There are different types of
Nodes: they may represent comments, text, or Elements (like HTML tags). The root
of the DOM is a Document object.

### Navigating

You can navigate a document using several properties (note that these are
properties, not methods, so you don't call them): `children`, `parentNode`,
`nextSibling`, `previousSibling`, `firstChild`, and `lastChild`, among others.
These methods deal with all types of Nodes (comments, text, Elements).

There are also Element-specific versions of some of them: `parentElement`,
`nextElementSibling`, `previousElementSibling`, `firstElementChild`,
`lastElementChild`. These will only return Elements, skipping over any
non-Element nodes.

### Finding elements

To find elements, use `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`. These are methods
on the Document object and on Element objects. The first method will find the
first matching element, returning `null` if no match is found. The second will
return a list (but **not** an array) of all matching elements.

When you call one of the query methods, the browser will search within the
element you called the method on. Saying `document.querySelector` will search
the entire document. If you have a reference to a specific element,
`elem.querySelector` will search only within that element.

The query methods take a string argument (the query) that uses CSS selector
syntax. So, to find the first `h2` elemnt in a document, you could say
`document.querySelector('h2')`. To find all `h2` elements, say
`document.querySelectorAll('h2')`. You can also search for items with specific
CSS classes (`querySelector('.rounded')`) or with IDs
(`querySelector('#search-button')`), or using any other CSS selector.

### Updating the DOM

You can add and remove elements from the DOM, and you can alter existing
elements.

To create an element, use Docment's `createElement` method, like:

```js
const item = document.createElement('li');
```

Once you have an element reference, you can adjust its properties, like:

```js
item.textContent = 'foo';
item.id = 'some-element';
```

There are a couple ways to change the content of an element. If the element
should only contain text, `textContent` is the property to use. If the element
should contain more complex content, you can use `innerHtml` to set the content
to a string of HTML, but the better way is usually to create new nodes and
append them to the element.

The typical way to add an element to a document or another element is with
`append`, like `document.body.append(someNode);`. This method adds an element to
the end of a node's list of children. Given the following document structure:

```html
<ul id="list">
  <li>One</li>
</ul>
```

Doing this:

```js
const list = document.querySelector('#list');
const item = document.createElement('li');
item.textContent = 'Two';
list.append(item);
```

would result in a structure like:

```html
<ul id="list">
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
</ul>
```

You can remove an element by calling `remove` on it.

You can replace or remove the children of an element using `replaceChildren`.
Calling `element.replaceChildren('Hello')` will replace the contents of an
element with the string 'Hello'. Calling `element.replaceChildren()` will
replace the children of the element with nothing, effectively clearing out the
element.

## Async

### setTimeout and setInterval

JavaScript has deep support for asynchronous ("async") execution. Async
execution is when code is scheduled to run at some later time. For example, the
`setTimeout` function lets you explicitly schedule a function (a "callback") to
run later:

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log('Hi'), 1000);
```

This will print 'Hi' to the console 1000ms after the `setTimeout` call is made.
What makes it async is that the JavaScript interpreter doesn't wait for the
async code to run before proceeding. If you run this:

```js
console.log('before');
setTimeout(() => console.log('in'), 1000);
console.log('after');
```

you'll see this in the console:

```
> before
> after
> in
```

The interpreter runs each statement in the order it's seen, so the first
`console.log` is run, then the `setTimeout` (which _schedules_ some function to
run, but it doesn't run it immediately), then the second `console.log`. After
1000ms, the scheduled function runs.

Other async functions we looked at were `setInterval` and `fetch`. `setInterval`
is similar to `setTimeout`, but it runs its callback repeatedly instead of only
once. `fetch` is used to fetch data from a URL.

`setInterval` and `setTimeout` schedule a function to be run in the future and
return an ID that can be used to cancel the timer/interval using `clearInterval`
or `clearTimeout`.

### Fetch and Promises

Rather than an ID, `fetch` returns a Promise. This is an object that represents
some future value. When the operation that returned the Promise completes, the
promise is "resolved" with the value of the operation. For a `fetch`, the
Promise will eventually resolve with the fetch response.

The way you get the resolved value of a Promise is to call the Promise's `then`
method. For example:

```js
const responsePromise = fetch('/someUrl');
responsePromise.then((response) => {
  console.log(`status: ${response.status}`);
});
```

It's a bit like scheduling a callback with `setTimeout`, except that instead of
running the callback after some specific delay, the callback is run whenever the
operation (in this case a network request) finishes. Note that just like
`setTimeout`, calling `then` is scheduling an async operation. If you do

```js
const promise = fetch('/url');
console.log('before');
promise.then((response) => console.log(response.status));
console.log('after');
```

you'll see something like this in the console (200 is a common response status):

```
> before
> after
> 200
```

Once you have a response, you have to call another method to actually read the
data out of it, either `text` or `json`. Both of these methods are async, and
return Promises. The Promise returned by `text` resolves to a string. The
Promise returned by `json` resolves to a JavaScript value (array, object, etc.).
Which method you should call depends on what you expect the `fetch` to have
returned.

```js
const responsePromise = fetch('/recipes/chocolate_cake');
const recipePromise = responsePromise.then((response) => {
  return response.json(); // this is a Promise
});
recipePromise.then((recipe) => {
  console.log(`The cake contains ${recipe.servings} servings`);
});
```

You might think that `recipePromise` above would resolve to a `Promise` since
`response.json()` returns a Promise. However, when you return a Promise in a
`then` callback, it will be resolved when you call `then` on the outer Promise.

### Async/await

While Promises have some advantages over simple callbacks, then can still be a
bit cumbersome to use. To simplify their usage, `async/await` syntax was added
to JavaScript.

With this syntax, you can use the `await` keyword to wait for a Promise to
resolve, saving you from needing to call `then`.

```js
const response = await fetch('/url');
console.log(response.status);
```

`await` makes the code act like synchronous code. If you have

```js
console.log('before');
const response = await fetch('/url');
console.log(response.status);
console.log('after');
```

you'll see this in the console:

```
> before
> 200
> after
```

The main caveat when using `await` is that **you can only use it inside a
function declared with `async`**:

```js
async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch('/recipes/chocolate_cake');
  const recipe = await response.json();
  return recipe;
}
```

### JSON

JSON is "JavaScript Object Notation". It's a way of representing complex
JavaScript values as strings, often for the purpose of sending them over a
network connection. When you say `response.json()` on a `fetch` response, the
browser interprets the data loaded from the server as a JSON string and turns it
into the corresponding JavaScript object.

A JSON value looks a lot like a JavaScript value. The main differences is that
object properties in JSON must **always** be quoted (the quotes are optional in
JavaScript and are rarely used). Also, JSON requires double quotes for strings
rather than single quotes.

This JavaScript value:

```js
{
  name: 'Bob',
  age: 32
}
```

would be this in JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "Bob",
  "age": 32
}
```

As a string, the above value would be:

```
'{"name": "Bob", "age": 32}'
```

When you have a JSON string, you can manually convert it to a JavaScript object
using `JSON.parse`:

```js
const obj = JSON.parse('{"name": "Bob", "age": 32}');
console.log(obj.name);
```

You can convert a JavaScript object or array to a JSON string using
`JSON.stringify`. When you call `response.json()`, the browser internally gets
the response value as text and then calls `JSON.parse` on it to return the value
as a JavaScript object.

## Events

Interacting with a page generates various events. For example, clicking the
mouse cursor on an element generates a 'click' event.

To listen for events, you add event listeners to the elements that will be
generating the events of interest. For example, if you want to know when a
specific button is clicked, you add a 'click' listener to it.

```js
const button = document.querySelector('#submit-button');
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log('button clicked!');
});
```

Events will "bubble" from the element that generated them. This allows container
elements to listen for events generated by child elements. In the following
structure, you could add a 'click' listener to the `#parent` element that would
see events generated by any of the buttons within it.

```html
<div id="parent">
  <button>OK</button>
  <button>Cancel</button>
</div>
```

Event handlers are called with the event triggered the handler. A click listener
will always be called with a MouseEvent.

```js
button.addEventListener((event) => {
  console.log(event);
});
```

Often you won't care about the event for button clicks, but it can be useful
when adding a listener to the parent element. You can look at the `target`
property on the event to see specifically which button was clicked.

Besides click events, another useful event is "keydown". This event is generated
by the currently focusd element when a key is pressed.

## Forms

### Elements

A form is a `<form>` element containing inputs, buttons, labels. The most common
input element is `<input>`. By default, an `<input>` is a text input, which is
single line that user can type text into. Using the `type` attribute, you can
make an `<input>` look and act differently. For example, `type="number"` will
make the input accept numbers, possibly showing some up and down arrows on the
right side to increment and decrement the value (browser dependent).
`type="checkbox"` will make the input show up as a clickable checkbox.

Inputs can be labeled with `<label>` elements. A label is just a string.
Generally you'll want to associate labels with specific inputs. You can do that
by embedding the input in the label, or by using a combination of an input `id`
and a label `for` attribute.

```html
<label>First name: <input name="first-name" /></label>

<label for="last-name">Last name:</label>
<input name="last-name" id="last-name" />
```

### Submitting

Generally a form lets a user enter some data and then click a "Submit" or "Save"
button. If you put a button in a form, by default it will be treated as a
"submit" button. When the user clicks it, the browser will attempt to submit the
form, which involves converting all the form values into a query string and then
making a request to submit the data. If no `action` attribute is specified for
the `<form>` element, the browser will try to submit to the current page. If an
`action` attribute is provide, the browser will try to submit to that address.
In either case, the browser will reload the page.

In a JavaScript-based web page, you don't usually want the browser to reload the
page. To prevent this from happening, you must specify the type of any buttons
as "button" using a `type` attribute, like:

```html
<button type="button">Submit</button>
```

This seems redundant, but it's necessary because the default type of a button in
a form is "submit". To submimt a form using JavaScript, you'll want to respond
to the click event of the submit button.

Within your click handler you'll want to gather the form data and then send it
to wherever the form data is supposed to be sent to. In class, we submitted data
using URL query strings. A query string in a URL comes after a '?', like:

```
http://recipes.com?search=foo&limit=10
```

The "search=foo&limit=10" part is the query string. It describes two properties,
"search" with a value of "foo", and "limit" with a value of "10". Properties in
the string are separated by '&'. If we were submitting a form with a single
input with the name "title", the query string might look like "title=cookies".

To generate a query string, you should use the URLSearchParams class.

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams();
params.set('title', 'cookies');
fetch(`http://recipes.com?${params}`);
```

An instance of this class works a lot like an object, but instead of using `[]`
to access properties, you use `set` and `get` methods. You `set` all the
properties you need, and then use the URLSearchParams instance in a string. When
it's converted to a string, it will automatically turn the set of properties and
values it contains into a properly formatted query string.

## React

React is a library for creating user interfaces. It provides a way to create
reasonable components. These may be very simple or very complex.

### Rendering

To use React, you render React elements into the DOM. You do this by calling
`React.render` with a React element and a DOM container element. The React
element is created using `React.createElement`, which is similar to
`document.createElement`. `React.createElement` takes up to three arguments: an
element type, element properties ("props"), and child elements.

```js
const container = document.querySelector("#some-element');
React.render(React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello world!'), container);
```

Thish renders an `<h1>` element containing 'Hello world!' into the element with
ID `some-element` in the document.

If something needs to change in the React content, generally because one or more
of the prop values changed, you simply call `React.render` again with the
element and the updated props.

### Components

A React component is a reusable UI element. Such a component can be something
very simple, like button, or something complex, like an entire application with
multiple screens an controls.

Components can be class-based or functional. In this course we've only talked
about functional components.

A React functional component is simply a function that accepts a single argument
of properties and returns a single React element (or null).

```js
function MyForm(props) {
  return React.createElement('form', {}, [
    React.createElement('input', {
      name: 'First name',
      value: props.firstName,
      onChange: (event) => props.setFirstName(event.target.value),
    }),
    React.createElement('input', {
      name: 'Last name',
      value: props.lastName,
      onChange: (event) => props.setLastName(event.target.value),
    }),
    React.createElement(
      'button',
      {
        onClick: () => {
          const params = new URLSearchParams();
          params.set('firstName', props.firstName);
          params.set('lastName', props.lastName);
          fetch(`/updateUser?${params}`);
        },
      },
      'Submit'
    ),
  ]);
}
```

Usually when a React component contains form inputs they are "controlled", which
means that the input values are passed in to the component, and the component
calls some function to update the value of an input.

### JSX

Writing components using `React.createElement` can be tedious, and the code can
be hard to follow. To make the code simpler, React components are often written
using JSX, an HTML-like syntax. Usign JSX, the MyForm component from above could
be written like:

```jsx
function MyForm(props) {
  return (
    <form>
      <input
        name="First name"
        value={props.firstName}
        onChange={(event) => props.setFirstName(event.target.value)}
      />
      <input
        name="Last name"
        value={props.lastName}
        onChange={(event) => props.setLastName(event.target.value)}
      />
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          const params = new URLSearchParams();
          params.set('firstName', props.firstName);
          params.set('lastName', props.lastName);
          fetch(`/updateUser?${params}`);
        }}
      >
        Submit
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

JSX makes the structure of a component a bit more obvious, and is generally
shorter than calling `React.createElement`.

One downside to JSX is that it's not actually JavaScript, so a browser can't run
it directly. To make JSX work in a browser, it must be built or transpile into
valid JavaScript. This is usually done using a tool like Babel. You write your
code using JSX, then run it through a build tool to get JavaScript that can be
loaded into a browser.

When writing components using JSX, you must **always** import React in the
component file. It may not look like you need to, because you will often not use
React directly, but the JavaScript code your JSX code is eventually converted to
_will_ use the React import.

### Rendering lists

One quirk of React comes up when rendering lists. Because of how it works behind
the scenes, React prefers to have some way to uniquely identify individual items
when rendering lists of items. It's not _necessary_, but it can significantly
improve rendering performance to give each item a unique `key` attribute. Often
this ends up looking like:

```jsx
return <ul>
  {items.map((item) => <li key={item}>{item}</li>)}
<ul>;
```

When providing a `key` attribute, the main thing to keep in mind is that it
should be a **unique** value within the context of the list. If each item in the
list happens to be a unique string, then using the item value as the key makes
sense. If the items are objects with some other unique property such as an `id`,
that may make sense to use as the key. If you don't provide a `key` attribute,
React will default to using the index of the item in the list.

### Managing state

By default a functional component can't have state. Functions accept values and
return values, but in general there's no way to save information between calls
of a function. To allow this kind of state-saving, React provides a `useState`
function (also know as the useState "hook").

```jsx
function MyComponent(props) {
  const [isSelected, setIsSelected] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsSelected(!isSelected)}>Click me</button>
      <div>Selected: {isSelected}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

`useState` returns two values in an array. The first value is a state variable.
The second value is a function that can be called to update the state variable.
In the component above, `isSelected` is the state variable and `setIsSelected`
can be use to set its value.

Note that calling the state setter does **not** immediately update the state
variable. The state variable will keep its value for the entire function call.
The new value will show up the **next time the component is rendered**. Calling
the state setter will schedule another render, which will happen after the
current render completes. That means that in the example below, `false` will be
printed initially, and then `true` will be printed a short time later.

```jsx
function MyComponent(props) {
  const [isSelected, setIsSelected] = useState(false);

  setIsSelected(true);
  console.log(isSelected); // initially prints false

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsSelected(!isSelected)}>Click me</button>
      <div>Selected: {isSelected}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Unit testing

Unit testing is the process of loading some unit of code, usually a function or
component, and exercising it to ensure it behaves as expected.

There are various frameworks that make reading and writing tests easier. One of
the most popular in the JavaScript ecosystem is Jest, but most frameworks work
similarly. You write your tests in test files, and a test runner loads the test
files, executes the tests they contain, and collects and displays the test
results.

### Structure

When using Jest, a test file will often look something like:

```js
import { add } from './mathOps.js';

test('add should add two numbers', () => {
  expect(add(1, 2)).toEqual(3);
});
```

The `test` and `expect` funtions are globally available when using Jest, meaning
that you don't need to import them from anywhere to use them in your test file.

The `test` function takes 2 arguments: a name for the test and a function that
actually executes the test. The test function itself should exercise the code of
interest, and then make assertions about whether it behaved properly.

### Assertions

In the example above, the test function is calling `add(1, 2)`, and then
checking that the returned value is 3. The `expect` function is one way of
making checks, and is the most common way to do this with Jest. To use `expect`,
you pass it a value and then make some sort of check. In the example above, the
value passed is `add(1, 2)`, and the specific check is `.toEqual(3)`. There are
a large number of build in checks (`.toBeGreaterThan`, `.toHaveBeenCalledWith`,
`.toBeNull`, `.toHaveLength`, ...).

You _could_ mostly get by with `.toBe(true)` or `.toBe(false)` along with
boolean tests (like `expect(add(1, 2) === 3).toBe(true)`, but it's always better
to use the most specific check that fits the test beign performed. Such a test
will be more meaningful when read (it will be easier to see what's being
checked), and if a test fails, the generated error message will also be more
meaningful. For example, to check the length of an array, use

```js
expect(arr).toHaveLength(10);
```

instead of

```js
expect(arr.length).toBe(10);
```

### Mock functions

Sometimes when running tests, you'll want to check whether a function is called.
For example, maybe you're testing a `renderRecipe` function that, as part of its
rendering process, calls a `renderIngredient` function that's passed into it.

```js
renderRecipe(recipe, (ing) => `${ing.amount} ${ing.units} ${ing.name}`);
```

When testing this function, you'll obviously want to check that the value
returned by `renderRecipe` is what was expected. You should _also_ check that
the `renderIngredient` function was called properly. To do that, your test will
need to be able to check that a function was called, and also check what
arguments it was called with.

Jest provides a useful tool for this: `jest.fn()`. This function will create a
new function that can be checked later to see if and how it was called. You
could use it in a test like:

```js
test('check that renderRecipe renders a recipe', () => {
  const renderRecipe = jest.fn();
  const recipe = {
    ingredients: [
      { name: 'egg', amount: '1' },
      { name: 'water', amount: '8', units: 'cups' },
    ],
  };
  const rendered = renderRecipe(recipe, renderRecipe);
  expect(rendered).toEqual(/* whatever it's supposed to be */);
  expect(renderRecipe).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
  expect(renderRecipe).toHaveBeenCalledWith([
    [recipe.ingredients[0]],
    [recipe.ingredients[1]],
  ]);
});
```

The above test checks that `renderRecipe` is called twice (once for each
ingredient). It also checks that the arguments used for each call where what was
expected.
